								<b>Background</b>
								<br>Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. 
								My research focuses on a range of transients resulting from accretion onto supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.
								I'm especially interested in multi-wavelength follow-up of optically-selected transient events.
								
								I was born and raised in Maryland and did my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. 
								After graduation in 2019, I moved to the University of Hawai'i to begin graduate school.

								<b>Research Interests</b>

								active galactic nucleus flares, active galactic nucleus variability, and transient host galaxies. I am also interested in a number of other time domain projects
								such as stellar flares.

								<b>Tidal Disruption Events</b>
								<br>A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is ripped apart by a supermassive black hole.
								Once a theoretical concept, we are now discovered tens of new TDEs per year thanks to the growth of transient sky surveys
								like the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), 
							        the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).
								
								<br>TDEs are promising probes of black holes, as information on properties like black hole mass and spin are imprinted on TDE observables.
								Nevertheless, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the physics behind TDE emission. With high-cadence surveys like ASAS-SN, we can discover nearby TDEs early in their evolution. This allows us to
								rapidly initiate follow-up photometry in the UV and optical and spectroscopy in the optical and X-ray. Such a combination probes the formation
								of an accretion disk and how TDE energetics evolve as the debris stream circularizes. In some lucky cases, a TDE is observed at high cadence 
								and high precision with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey satellite, allowing us to robustly constrain the rise slope and rise time. As we build
								samples of well-observed TDEs, new trends have been discovered that move us closer to a full understanding of TDE physics.

								<b>Active Galactic Nucleus Variability</b>
								<br>Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the actively accreting supermassive black holes at the centers of roughly 10% of galaxies
								in the local universe.
